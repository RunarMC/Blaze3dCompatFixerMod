## Blaze3d Compatibility Patch

### I made this mod because Forge `1.16.5-36.2.38` have a serious issue with Blaze3d, the method was missing.

## Patched method
1. `isUsingFBO()Z`

### This mod is made for only one purpose, Patching Blaze3d's`isUsingFBO()Z` method.

# Be aware !
## This mod can break Optifine patcher, I won't give any support to this. 
## If you need to use Optifine you'll probably need to make some work around!
